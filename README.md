## About The Project
The main motivation behind this project was to greatly improve my ability in building and working with API's. I have already build a couple of API's in Python(with Flask). 
Since JavaScript(NodeJS) was a relatively new addition in my tech stack, this was a great opportunity to both upgrade my skills in back-end development with Node and 
to enhance my understanding of what a proper API structure is. I really wanted to make this project more authentic, so I decided to do a small website for booking tours in Bulgaria.

The **main focus of this project is the API** - where I have spent about **75%** of my efforts. I also decided to create a simple front-end (vanilla JS, HTML, CSS) that showcases an
example of how the API might be consumed.

Most of the webpages are **rendered server-side - EJS templates**. To improve experience and user notifications I have also included some frontend JS - mainly with form submition and admin menu.

I have **deployed the project on my own Ubuntu 18.04 server**, so you can check it out for yourself. You'll find a link below

## Check out the Project
As I mentioned, I have created an example frontend that uses part of the API's functionality. You can check the project at:
https://bultravel.bogoapps.site/

There are different types of user roles[user,guide,admin], which have different permissions.

You can log **as an user** with:
**USERNAME**: "marto@example.com"
**PASSWORD**: "password"
OR create an account yourself(No spam - promise :D)

You can log in **as an admin** (access to the admin menu) with:
**USERNAME**: "admin@admin.com"
**PASSWORD**: "admin"
* I have restricted the update operations to superadmins(myself) intentionally - to keep it simple 😅.

I'm using **Stripe in TEST mode** - so just type **4242 4242 4242 4242** as payment card.

## About the API
### API Reference
I have used POSTMAN for testing and building the API. I also used it to generate a simple documentation, so you can easily check it's structure. This is the link to the documentation:
https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/16479105/UVsQriWC

### Features
* Standart CRUD operations for creating and modifying Tours, Users, Bookings, Reviews
* Filtering on resources - searching, pagination, less than/greater than, exclude/include fields, sort asc/desc, limit number of results etc.
* Priviliges based on user role - lead-guides and admins can modify tours, only admins can modify users, only users can write reviews etc.
* Forget password functionality. Sends a restoration link on email (expires in 10 min) for password reset.
* Payment with Stripe - e.g receiving webhooks from strype on successfull payment.
