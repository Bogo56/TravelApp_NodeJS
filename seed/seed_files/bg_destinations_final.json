    "description": "“Rural Bulgaria” is the best choice you can make to escape in the countryside from the concrete jungle and the stress of the modern city. Our easy to moderate hiking treks are nicely combined with overnight stays in traditional villages and guesthouses, set in rolling landscapes. Enjoy the stunning panoramas and walking trails of the Balkan, the Rhodopes (Rodopi), Pirin and Rila mountains, exploring them on foot during daytime. While in the evenings you will feel the spirit of a century-old life and sincere hospitality, combined with delicious local cuisine, based on organic food and home-made drinks (wine and fruit brandy among them).",
